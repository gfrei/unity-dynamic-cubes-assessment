Assessment Definition
We would like you to create in a sphere-shaped area, at-least 1500 cubes spawning dynamically at runtime.
Details
1.  Each cube should have:
    a.  Random position within the sphere
    b.  random colour
    c.  random size
    d.  random lifetime.
    e.  rotate in sync with a parent and also locally (but with different speeds).
    f.  fade away when the life reaches the end.
    g.  Expired cubes should be replaced by new ones.
2. Initialization speed of cubes will be considered
3. Clean architecture will be considered
4. Extra points
    a.  Be able to easily replace the cube with any other shape inside a prefab.
    b.  Exposed values for min/max of color, size, lifetime, and also the speed of sphere/cube rotation.
    c.  At least 60FPS in a GTX1080 ( we'll test in our machines )
    d.  More than 1500 cubes
Please do not use any third-party library/asset.
No need for directional light but you can use standard material
Also, export your work as a .unitypackage with all files that we need to evaluate your work.
Preferred unity versions would be any 2020.3.xx.
