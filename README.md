# unity-dynamic-cubes-assessment
A Unity project that spawns cubes dynamically at runtime in a sphere-shaped area
---
**Assessment Definition**

Create in a sphere-shaped area, at-least 1500 cubes spawning dynamically at runtime.

Details

1.  Each cube should have:
   
    a.  Random position within the sphere

    b.  random colour

    c.  random size

    d.  random lifetime

    e.  rotate in sync with a parent and also locally (but with different speeds)

    f.  fade away when the life reaches the end

    g.  Expired cubes should be replaced by new ones

3. Initialization speed of cubes will be considered

4. Clean architecture will be considered

5. Extra

   a.  Be able to easily replace the cube with any other shape inside a prefab.

   b.  Exposed values for min/max of color, size, lifetime, and also the speed of sphere/cube rotation.

   c.  At least 60FPS in a GTX1080

   d.  More than 1500 cubes
